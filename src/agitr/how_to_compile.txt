Chapter 3: A Gentle Introduction to Ros.
Description: This is a step by step guide
		obtained by the Gentle Introduction to Ros textbook
		on how to compile a cpp file with the catkin build
		system.

	1. Desclaring Dependancies
		- for hello.cpp
			a) Add the roscpp client library in the CmakeList.txt
			   and package.xml file. This ensure that catkin 
			   provides a C++ compiler.
			b) Add a run_depend and build_depend tag 'roscpp'.
			   You program will compile without it but
			   if you export the package to another system that does
			   no have it they wont be able to compile.	

	2. Declaring Executables
		2 Places where you need to modify inside CmakeList.txt.
		1- You need to tell Cmake the name of the executables
		   as well as all the source files needed to build it.
		2- You need to specify all the libraries like 'roscpp'
		   need from find_package()
	
	3. Building the workspace.	
		- Run the command 'catkin_make' inside the home directory
		  of you workspace.
	** Remember to source you devel/setup.bash of the package.
