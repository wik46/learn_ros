How to move the ur10 arm with gazebo.
=================================================================================

1. Launch the gazebo simulator with an empty world.
* roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

2. Insert the ur10 arm using the gazebo gui.

3. Open a new terminal window and search for the topics that are being published.
*  Remember if a node publishes on a topic, then it send data to all the
	nodes that subsribe to this topic.
* rostopic list.

4. We see that there is a gazebo/set_link_state topic that looks very promising.
*  Run rqt_graph in the command line and untick the debug mode to see how these nodes
	sent and receive data from each other.
